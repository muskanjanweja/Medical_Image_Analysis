# Medical_Image_Analysis
The project is used to analyse medical image using deep learning. CNN is used to create this model. One of the file consists the dataset which has images of lungs and the model 
will help to predict whether the image is normal or not.
This model can help the doctors to diagnose the healthy or unhealthy lungs while predicting the ultrasound of an image.
